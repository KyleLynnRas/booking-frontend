# Booking Site 

### Summary 

A booking site for Peculiarity Productions to showcase different available performance packages and allow users to request a quote.  Users are able to sign up and log in and JWT is used to ensure users are logged in before accessing the pages. Users can see all reviews for a specific performace, and perform full CRUD operations on the review model by making requests to the backend booking-api.

## Future Goals 

- Restrict a user from editing or deleting a review they did not make. 
- Models are set up for the capabilty for a user to "favorite" a performance, and sort a performance by category. I hope to write the frontend code soon.
- Video headers
- Booking form using EmailJS
- Add an expiration for the JWT
- Add a logout feature
